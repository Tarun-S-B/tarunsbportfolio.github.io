                    </span> is BlackRock’s
                    proprietary investment platform developed in the late 1980s. It integrates portfolio management,
                    risk analytics, trading, and operations into a single unified system.

                <h2><span class="important">History and Influence</span></h2>
                <p> Aladdin began in 1988 on a single Sun workstation (pioneered by Charles Hallac and Benett Golub).
                    Its first major client was GE’s Kidder Peabody mortgage portfolio in 1994. Strong external demand
                    led BlackRock to productize Aladdin for third parties, forming BlackRock Solutions in 2000.
                    The platform’s analytics proved valuable during market crises, cementing BlackRock’s reputation for
                    risk technology. Aladdin has evolved via heavy R&D and client-driven enhancements, and it now
                    underpins roughly $18–22 trillion of assets. About 210 institutional clients use some form of
                    Aladdin deployment.
                    BlackRock aims for 30% of its revenue to come from tech-related services like Aladdin licensing,
                    making Aladdin a strategic asset often described as “the operating system for investment managers.”

                    the end of case study).
                    This is a mere hypothetical representation of how different components of the ALADDIN System are
                    connected amongst each other. As the original System Design is proprietary and confidential.

                    the stocks, portfolio of the clients that they are handling, News articles published which give

                    Data from multiple sources reaches the Data Lake in different formats, like JSON, CSV, Text and

                                    the graph that represent the latency (delay) of traversing that connection.

                                    like Dijkstra's then naturally prioritize paths with lower cumulative edge weights,

                                    selecting the route that data packets can travel in the shortest amount of time.
                                    These
                                    weights can be dynamic, changing with network congestion or other real-time

                                    In context of the shortest path algorithm, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm
                                    which
                                    can handle negative weights and avoid the loop, cycles. But in real-life scenarios
                                    there
                                    is no negative weights latency so we have to preferably use another algorithm.

                                Before allowing data to traverse a node or an edge, a check is performed to ensure the

                <p> Queues are critical for modeling the real-world behavior of packet buffers in network devices or

                    simulate how
                    packets or data
                    items are handled under congestion. For networking, they replicate bufferbloat effects, track ACK
                    delays, and analyze how congestion control interacts with queuing disciplines like RED or CoDel. In
                    trading systems, queues are useful in managing order sequencing, stream processing, and tick data.
                    Their behavior under load can reveal performance bottlenecks and is central to scheduling and buffer
                    management, especially when latency and fairness are key concerns.

                <p>
                    Scheduling algorithms determine the order of packet or order execution. Round-robin scheduling
                    ensures fairness by rotating through available queues, while Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) allocates
                    bandwidth proportionally. In networking, these affect RTT and throughput, shaping traffic to ensure
                    service quality. In trading systems, these principles guide execution engines in balancing multiple
                    order streams or asset classes. Implementing these algorithms is crucial for understanding and
                    controlling latency, jitter, and fairness in complex environments.

                <h2 class="important">BlackRock Messaging System (BMS) - Overview & Design Principles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Context: BMS is the architecture that powers Aladdin, connecting thousands of services across
                        multiple data centers and regions. It was developed by BlackRock many years ago and has since
                        evolved.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            Aladdin's Architecture Design Rules Driving BMS:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>"One BlackRock":</strong> Single way to access data or perform actions
                                    (e.g.,
                                    book a trade). Avoid reinventing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Front-end Isolation:</strong> Front-end applications must use backend
                                    services;
                                    no direct database or filesystem access.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Service Agility & Scalability:</strong> Services can run on any host, be
                                    moved,
                                    and scaled by starting additional instances. Applications using services should not
                                    need
                                    to know service host locations or manage load-balancing.
                                </li>

                                <li>Provides several messaging paradigms.</li>
                                <li>Resilient to outage, with automatic recovery guaranteed within two minutes
                                    ("2-Minute
                                    Non-Stop" feature).</li>
                                <li>Secure: Every message tagged with unspoofable user and client identifiers.</li>
                                <li>Hot-deployable, reducing risk of changes to BMS itself.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        <li>
                            Client Libraries & Frameworks:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Libraries available in Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, Perl, C#, and Julia.</li>
                                <li>Recent addition of HTTP client support (vanilla HTTP/REST access to services).</li>
                                <li>Application server frameworks built on top, like BEAM2 (Java), allowing for rapid
                                    development of secure services.</li>
                            </ul>

                                Mechanism: Simple and most common, used for stateless requests. Application sends a
                                request, service replies with at least one response.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Load Balancing: BMS load balances requests across all service instances.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Resilience: BMS optionally retries requests if a service crashes/disconnects. Queues
                                requests if a service is slow or temporarily down, preventing errors to users even
                                during a full service restart.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Usage: Also used for "send-and-forget" messages due to BMS's high reliability.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                    Mechanism: For stateful, back-and-forth interactions. Starts like Request/Response,
                                    then
                                    establishes a bidirectional 'channel' once the service accepts.

                                    Notifications: Both application and service are notified by BMS of channel issues
                                    (e.g.,
                                    service crash, application disconnect).

                                    Use Cases: "Get and subscribe" requests (e.g., fetch current stock price and
                                    subscribe
                                    to changes). Used as the communication backbone for BlackRock's "compute farms"
                                    (schedulers to executors).
                                </li>

                        Message Handling: Applications can send many requests over a single connection. Each request is
                        tagged with an application-unique ID. Responses/errors are tagged with the same ID, allowing
                        responses to be received in any order and avoiding head-of-line blocking.

                    <li>
                        Connections: Applications (clients and servers) connect to a BmsServer instance via TCP or Unix
                        Sockets.
                        <ul>

                    <li>
                        Resiliency Feature - "2-Minute Non-Stop": Guarantees the BMS network will self-heal after host

                        Configuration: BMS is designed to be light on configuration; no routes to configure or hardcode.

                    <li>
                        Registration & Advertisement: When a service connects to a BmsServer, it declares the message
                        types/topics it handles. The BmsServer advertises this to other BmsServers, propagating updates
                        across the network.

                        the remote end of a WAN link, which then forwards locally. Repeaters are regular BmsServer
                        instances.

                                Mechanisms: Supports various methods, from username/password to "process inspection"
                                (BMS discovers user from the OS).

                                User/Client Code: Included in every message header by BMS; cannot be spoofed (attempts
                                result in connection termination). This provides a source of truth for downstream
                                service authorization checks.

                                    <li>Controls who can register to *receive* requests (typically not normal users).

                                    <li>Any user can register for broadcasts, but service owners can restrict access to
                                        specific broadcast topics.</li>
                                    <li>Anyone can *send* requests and broadcasts on any topic (performance benefit:
                                        authorization checks mainly at connection time).</li>

                                Control Messages: Special messages for operating BMS are authorized and limited to
                                select super users.

                    <li>
                        Challenge: Enabling effective communication across different programming languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        BMS Payload: To BMS, a message payload is just bytes, allowing any encoding format.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>BRMap Solution:</strong> A binary and ASCII serialization format created by BlackRock to
                        represent all needed data types (chars, shorts, longs, doubles, strings, byte arrays, maps,
                        arrays, tabular data, dates, date-times, timestamps).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Characteristics:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-describing (like JSON): Keys and data types are encoded with the data, simplifying
                                display and debugging.</li>
                            <li>Multi-language support: One of the first libraries developed when adopting a new
                                language in Aladdin.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Principle: Along with all services being on the same BMS network, BRMap ensures applications and
                        services can effectively communicate.

                            <li>Enables rapid creation of services to solve business needs.</li>
                            <li>Allows central solutions for hard problems (e.g., authentication), saving time and
                                money.</li>
                            <li>Supports scalability for support teams and the growing developer community.</li>

                                Scale: BMS routing ~50 billion messages per day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Focus: Adding routing capacity, richer service level metrics for service owners and
                                operations.

                                Future Investment: Exploring how messaging in Aladdin will work in a hybrid, multi-cloud
                                deployment model, and BMS evolution for these needs.

                                orchestration.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Separation of duties (BMS outside K8s clusters) vs. tighter integration (single
                                        control set).</li>
                                    <li>Initial step: Created a cloud-native K8s sidecar for brokering communication and
                                        authentication between K8s pods and BMS.</li>
